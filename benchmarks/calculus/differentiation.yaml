      This is an example of simple differentation.

      Here we might have lots of text describing possibly algorithmic details and
      stuff. Note that diff10 makes a very large expression. I wonder if something
      like markdown should be supported here so that it can render nicely like here
      is an equation::

          \frac{d}{dx}\sin^5(x)
    inputs:
      - e: sin(sin(sin(sin(sin(x)))))
        x: x
    time:
      - name: diff
        operation: diff(e, x)
        assert_close: evalf(subs(result, x, 1.0)) == 0.1234
      - name: diff2
        operation: diff(e, x)
        assert_close: evalf(subs(result, x, 1.0)) == 0.1654
      - name: diff10
        operation: diff(e, x, 10)
        assert_close: evalf(subs(result, x, 1.0)) == 0.5678
